## Setup
1. Configure your Raspberry Pi according to the [docs provided by Waveshare](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2.7inch_e-Paper_HAT_Manual#Working_With_Raspberry_Pi).
2. Clone this repo:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/MrLucker518/e-ink-birthday-tracker.git
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Install libopenjp2 required by Pillow:
    ```
    sudo apt-get install libopenjp2-7
    ```
5. Copy the `config.json.example` file as `config.json` and set the birth date.
6. Configure cron to run the `main.py` file on a schedule (e.g. every 30 mins).
7. Optional step: You can edit birthday.py to change wording from Czech language

## Testing
If you wish to try out the package locally, you can run the `local_test.py` file. The script generates the image and displays it on your screen without the need of relying on packages that are available only on Raspberry Pi.
